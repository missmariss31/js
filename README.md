# Do Some JavaScript

This is a repository where Jesse and Marissa program JavaScript.

## Yeah, we're going to do JavaScript!!!

* First I will write some tests for a fictitious set of functions.
* Then I'll write some simple acceptance criteria
* Then you can try to make my tests succed by writing the function :D

## This is going to be FUN!

```
    ()_()()_()
    / ..)(.. \
 __/  ( || )  \_
(_/    *  *   (_)
 |       |   | ||
 |  |    |   \_/|
 \__/    |      |
   >      \    /
  <__,--,__|/|_>
```

# Getting Started

> Note: You will need to intall node.js
> Just download the latest version from https://nodejs.org/en/

In the command line

`cd` to the js directory on your computer.

then run the following command.

```
npm install
```
This will install Mocha, which is a cool unit testing library. 


*How to run the tests*

To run the tests just run the following commands in the command line:

```
npm test
```

Other Notes:

All the tests will be written in a .spec.js file right next to the .js file which has the code to be tested.
