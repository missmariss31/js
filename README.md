# Learn git

This is a repository where Jesse and Marissa programmed JavaScript.

## Yeah, we're going to do JavaScript!!!

* First I will write some tests for a fictitious set of functions.
* Then I'll write some simple acceptance criteria
* Then you can try to make my tests succed by writing the function :D

## This is going to be FUN!

```
